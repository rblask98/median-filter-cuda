# median-filter-cuda
The filter implementation is done using the Nvidia CUDA Toolkit and the OpenCV library. The Nvidia CUDA Toolkit contains various tools necessary for parallelizing the problem, while the OpenCV library contains functions for loading an image from the processor to the graphics card and vice versa, as well as for filtering the image itself.
